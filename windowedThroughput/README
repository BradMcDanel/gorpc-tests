Multi-server, Multi-client, variable-length message + window size benchmark?
===

Basic usage: (from inside the windowedThroughput folder, this assumes that 
				export GOPATH=$HOME/go
				export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
				have been set)
 * go install windowedThroughput
 * windowedThroughput   [-ns number of servers]
 						[-nc number of clients]
 						[-ml message length]
 						[-nm number of messages each client should send]
 						[-ws window size]

 This will set up ns servers, each connected to approx nc/ns unique clients.
 Each client will then send a total of nm messages, each of length ml to
 its connected server, with a window size of ws. The output will be the throughput in megabytes/s
