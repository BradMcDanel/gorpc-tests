Multi-server, Multi-client, variable-length message + window size benchmark?
===

Basic usage:
 * go install gorpc-tests/variableMessage
 * variableMessage  [-ns number of servers]
 					[-nc number of clients]
 					[-ml message length]
 					[-nm number of messages each client should send]
 					[-ws window size]

 This will set up ns servers, each connected to ~nc/ns unique clients.
 Each client will then send ws number of messages, each of length ml to
 its connected server, and then wait for responses to all of them (the response
 is the message echoed back). The output will be the throughput in megabits/s
