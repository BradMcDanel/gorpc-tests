Google Snappy Benchmark
===
For large transfers where the data is compressible and the network is commidity / under stress,
Google Snappy may well lead to substantial performance wins.

go get code.google.com/p/snappy-go/snappy
go build dfs.go
./dfs --server=True
time ./dfs --calls=100
time ./dfs --snappy --calls=100

If you are running the server on a different computer:
time ./dfs --host=resonance.seas.harvard.edu --snappy --calls=100
